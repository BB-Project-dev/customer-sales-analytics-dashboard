📈 Key Insights

Revenue and profit move consistently with overall performance fluctuations.

Revenue growth alone does not guarantee profitability; return rates and margin structure significantly impact net profit.

Category-level analysis reveals large revenue gaps.

Profit generally shows a positive correlation with revenue; however, Electronics generates disproportionately high revenue relative to profit, indicating margin sensitivity.

2️⃣ Customer Segmentation Analysis

🎯 Major Findings
🔹 Most Profitable Age Group: 56+

Highest total revenue

Highest total profit

Strongest revenue-to-profit alignment

This segment demonstrates the strongest overall contribution to business performance.

🔹 Gender Distribution

Female: 48.2%

Male: 47.06%

Customer distribution is nearly balanced, suggesting that profitability differences are driven more by age segmentation than gender.

🔹 Revenue vs Profit Relationship by Age

18–25 group shows the weakest revenue-to-profit relationship.

56+ group shows the strongest positive correlation.

Other age groups follow a moderate upward trend.

Overall, revenue and profit demonstrate a generally positive upward relationship across age segments.

🔹 Notable Observation (Multi-Metric View)

The 56+ segment:

Has the highest revenue

Has the highest total profit

Has the lowest Average Order Value

This suggests frequent purchasing behavior with smaller basket sizes — indicating strong long-term customer value potential.

3️⃣ Category & Regional Performance

📦 Category Insights

🟢 Electronics

Highest revenue

Core revenue driver of the business

Strong revenue–profit alignment

🔵 Grocery

Lowest revenue

Lowest profit

Likely low-margin, high-frequency category

🔴 Fashion

Highest return rate

Margin leakage risk

Operational improvement opportunity

🌎 Regional Insights

Central region records the lowest revenue contribution.

Indicates potential under-penetration or demand limitation.

Suggests opportunity for strategic expansion or marketing optimization.

📊 Strategic Takeaways

Profitability is driven more by age segmentation than gender distribution.

The 56+ segment is the most valuable customer group.

High return rate categories (e.g., Fashion) reduce overall margin efficiency.

Electronics dominates revenue but may face margin sensitivity risk.

Regional imbalance indicates growth opportunity in Central region.
